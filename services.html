So if the bank FD returns are 7% per annum, this model is expected to deliver anywhere between 21% to 35% per annum. The trading is done in Nifty futures. Few advantages - One makes money when market goes up and when market goes down, no prior knowledge of trading is required, no need to watch the markets continuously - just 15 mins per day and you are done, no analysis required you just need to follow the system and count your profits.
